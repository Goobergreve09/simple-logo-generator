## Description

I have created a simple logo generator to use for projects and applications for myself as a feelance web developer. It is created completely with Javascript. Using a 3 letter acronym like DET, or whatever is type through an input prompt, it creates the acronym for you logo. Then the prompt asks for a shape that you would like your logo to be. You also get to select what color scheme you would like my typing in a color or pasting a hexadecimal into the input field. 

My main motivation for this application was for a SIMPLE and quick way to create a logo for myself and/or others whilst saving money and not paying a graphic designer.

## Installation

Before using this generator you first need to install it. Even before that make sure you have [**VS-Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [**Gitbash**](https://gitforwindows.org/), as well as the latest version of [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download) already installed onto your pc. If you have those 3 already installed, *Follow these steps:*

**1.** Clone the code preferably using an SSH from the green button that says *'Code'* at the top of this page

**2.** Open gitbash and `cd` into the directory you'd like it cloned
   
**3.** type `git clone` and then paste the url previously copied and hit enter

**4.** `cd` into the simple-logo-generator directory
   
**5.** You'll need to install the Node Package manager because it does not come with the copied code. in the command line type `npm init -y`
   
**6.** Next - Install the inquirer by typing `npm install inquirer` into the command line

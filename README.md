## Description

I have created a simple logo generator to use for projects and applications for myself as a feelance web developer. It is created completely with Javascript. Using a 3 letter acronym like DET, or whatever is typed through an input prompt, it creates the acronym for you logo. Then the prompt asks for a shape that you would like your logo to be. You also get to select what color scheme you would like my typing in a color or pasting a hexadecimal into the input field. 

My main motivation for this application was for a SIMPLE and quick way to create a logo for myself and/or others whilst saving money and not paying a graphic designer.

## Setup

Before using this generator I first had to make sure I had the necessary applications installed. The applications include [**VS-Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [**Gitbash**](https://gitforwindows.org/), as well as the latest version of [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Next I had to *Follow these steps:*

**1.** Within my project directory I am using the Node Package Manager. I installed this by typing `npm i` into the CLI.

**2.** In this project I am using nodes *inquirer* package, so I then installed *inquirer* by typing `npm install inquirer` into the CLI.
   
**3.** Also in this project I have created tests to see if the app is functioning as expected. To run these tests I am using nodes *jest* package, so I then installed *jest* by typing `npm install jest` into the CLI.

**4.** In order to push my project to the github repository I had to create a *.gitignore* file with the content *node_modules* so that the node modules would not be pushed.
   
**5.** Once this was finished, my project is now ready to run.

## Usage

Now that the necessary files and applications are installed, it's  time to generate the logo.svg In VS.code *Follow these steps*.

1. Right-Click on the javascript file titled *index.js* and click *Open Integrated Terminal*

2. type `node index.js` into the command line

3. Answer the prompts in the command line - hexidecimals may be used when choosing a color ([HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/))

4. Once finished the green text *Generatedlogo.svg* will be displayed to imply it was a success.

5. Lastly, reveal the logo using the *file explorer*
